   We might want to keep the border for Index and Price to separate them? 
   User said "Except Price and Index". 
   Let's keep the row border effectively, but maybe lighten it?
   Actually, if I remove border-top of the empty cells, 
   Use specific selectors to matches the "blank" cells.

/* Ensure the Index and Price cells still have their separation if desired. 
   Usually in a group, Price is key, so it should be separated. 
   Since we applied border-top: none to SPECIFIC cells above, 
   Index and Price (which don't have those classes or specific selection above) 
   will retain their border-top (from standard td style, which is border-bottom of prev row).
   Wait, standard is border-bottom.
   If table collapse, border-top of Current = border-bottom of Prev.
   So removing border-top of Current removes the separator.

/* Optional: Add hover effect for the whole group? */
/* When hovering a group-continue, maybe highlight the group-start too? 
   Hard to do with CSS only (need parent or JS). 
   For now, standard hover is fine.
